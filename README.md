## Analysis Process
1. **Data Preprocessing**: [Describe any preprocessing steps applied to the data, such as handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, etc.]

2. **Model Training**: Each model is trained using the training dataset and evaluated using the validation dataset. Hyperparameters are tuned as necessary.

3. **Model Evaluation**: After training, each model is evaluated using the testing dataset to assess its performance.

4. **Results Visualization**: Finally, the performance of all models is visualized using ROC curves to compare their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
